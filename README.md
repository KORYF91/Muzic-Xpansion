<!-- WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES -->

By using the api for youtube and seatgeek we are making calls of that search the specified inputs value. "Basically searching for what the user types."
with the magic styling of bootstrap and jquery and we are blending the two to create the experience that is muzicXpansion.
we are using the JSON AJAX call to use the get method to get the results of the user's input. 
once the call is made the information is present we are using jquery to dynamically present the specified information pulled from the array of the JSON data. 
in the case of youtube that is the videos, recommended videos and the titles and descriptions. 
in the case of seatgeek it is the Concert information and link to buy tickets to go see the desired.

THE BONES - OR BEHIND THE CURTAIN
This was an effort of three people. 
Beginning with the simple HTML file, the code begins to take its shape. 
We made our first set files and folders. 
This made the management of the source code easy to handle look at. We also confingured the git repo so that all merges to the master have to be done approved by another member of the repo. This allows the merging of the code to move slightly smoother and to keep all the developers on the same page.
